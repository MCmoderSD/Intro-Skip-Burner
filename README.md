# Intro Skip Burner

This is a simple script that allows you to burn the .edl files generated by [Intro-Skipper](https://github.com/intro-skipper/intro-skipper) into your video files as chapters. <br>
That way you can skip intro and outro without the need of a video player that supports the Intro-Skipper plugin. <br>

Currently only .mp4 files are supported, but you can modify the code to support other formats. <br>
The script will **OVERRIDE** the original video file, so make sure to have a backup. <br>

## Requirements

You need [Java 21 LTS](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your system. <br>
Make sure to add FFmpeg to your PATH. <br>

The script was tested on Windows 11, but should work on other systems as well. <br>

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/MCmoderSD/Intro-Skip-Burner/releases/latest)
2. Place the .jar file in the same directory as your video files and .edl files
3. Run the .jar file with the following command: <br>
   `java -jar intro-skip-burner.jar`

Optionally you can pass the path to the directory as an argument: <br>
`java -jar intro-skip-burner.jar "C:\path\to\your\directory\"`
